- Fixed waterfal/no-waterfall display proportions between devices and orientation combinations
- Temporarily disabled the select/copy 


B0.4.0
- Added Android support library for backward compatibility for Notifications (for API < 11). 
  Now notifications of the modem running are displayed in all versions of Android the app will run on. 
  This bring back the menu (action overflow) button in the action bar for devices without a hardware menu button.
- Changed to standard style across Android versions and adjusted for consistent display between various device screen sizes.
- Removed display of the windows titles and replaced with modern actions bar (opens-up easy access to future functions).
- Re-instated the clipboard select/copy on terminal and modem screens.
- Added progress indicator of percent TXed characters in title bar.
- Reformatted the overflow/menu button on top action bar to match action bar height (horizontal instead of vertical)
- Added a blank form plus auto save for forms with checksum errors (similar to Flmsg).

- Added: Update mode information in title when we change mode inside an Outbox form view.
- Sort Forms either by name (in Forms and Templete views) or by reverse date in Inbox, Drafts, Outbox and Sent views.
- Added message Rx timeout to abort message reception. Adjustable from 1 to 10 Seconds in preferences as per Fldigi.
- Restored back button from messages displays, but with warning and double back key safety.
- Added DominoEx mode (NON FEC for the time being as THOR seems better then DOMINOEX + FEC at the same speed).
- Bug fix: option Modem/Modem Volume now controls modem ouput also. Was only working on Tune volume until now.
- Bug fix: web-page buttons would often(!) not work on devices with API 17 onwards (Jelly_Beans_MR1). Added @JavascriptInterface to the interface methods.



B0.5.0
- Made re-sampling and RSID FFT processing conditional. Saves CPU load on old devices with 
     ARM v6 CPUs (and older ARM V7 ones too) and permits more modes to be used on these devices. 
     Enabled only when Rx Rsid and waterfall ARE in use.
- Changed priority of background Modem thread to normal to balance between modem and GUI. No 
     impact visible on modern devices.
- Copied Slow CPU processing options from Java modems in AndPskmail. Allows for more of the MFSK, 
     PSKR, Thor and DominoEx modes to be used. Essential for devices with ARM v6 processors (until 
     recently most low cost Android devices).
- Changed Slow CPU option default from Yes to No as most modern devices do not need that option and
     leaving it on slightly degrades the decoding capability.
- Added transfer in/out of html forms. This allows receiving then installing OR transmitting 
     custom forms over the radio (as per Flmsg).
- Added button "Install Received HTML form" (when received over radio).
- Bug fix: Fix display of HTML reserved characters (<>&\n). Was missing the semicolumn after the entity name.
- Reduce digital modes list to a useful set for message passing (as per Flmsg list plus a few).
- Removed smoothing of signal quality display ("the green bar"). Now displays raw value from modems.
- Added option when sharing a message: now has WRAP, HTML and RAW (as in raw Flmsg file ) formats proposed.
- SAMSUNG & WIKO Action Bar bug simple workaround (try/catch) - needs testing.
- Added logging of Share actions into log file.
- Changed menu icons to same ones for all resolutions.
- Added preference for application theme (System default, Dark theme or Small screen Dark theme).
- Modified ICS-213 as per Flmsg V2.0.9 (added Optional Incident field).
- Added MFSK image reception. Added access to RX images via Android Gallery.



B0.6.0
- Re-added PSK31 and PSK63 modes as per suggestion. Does not have AFC yet, so it needs RSID for 
     precise frequency alignment.
- Changed the preference theme to always use the system default theme. On some devices the 
     checkboxes would not show as they would be the same colour as the background.
- Added "Light" UI scheme and removed black background from the system default scheme.


B0.7.0 (Not Released)
- Changed defaults at new install: RxRSID and TxRSID are ON, mode is MT63-2000-L.
- Added CSV form. Editing is in plain text OR via an external csv handling app (e.g. OfficeSuite)


V1.0.0 (Not Released)
- Fixed GUI performance issue visible after large accumulation of received characters in the modem screen
- Added 8PSK modes (includes preliminary 8PSK500F x 2 Carriers)
- Added UTF-8 support in Rx and Tx. Should works will all left-to-right texts and Asian text.
- Fixed delay and warning for double back button press to exit a form screen
- Fixed display to show mode in action bar when screen width is limited
- Added forced display of overflow button in action bar
- Renamed "FORM" screen button to "Compose" to reflect Email concept more closely.
- In message compose screen, renamed "TFER by RADIO" button into "TFER FORM ONLY" as 
     it could be mistaken as a way to send the composed message over radio.
- Fixed bug in "Share Message" action from Outbox and Sent folders
- Added overlay notification for message screens (same as Terminal and Modem screens).


V1.1.0 (Not Released)
- Added attached picture option for forms. Transmission is done either digitally as part of 
     the message (small images/fast modes) or in MFSK image modes immediately after the 
     transmission of the message text.
- Added "Picture Form" with GPS coordinates.
- Added handling of HTML5 elements, without data entry help and validation at this time. The 
     forms used on PC Flmsg are recognized but the data entry does not show date choosers and does
     not validate at this point.
- Minimized memory use during images processing (release of large unused objects).
- Added options for TX of images: digital or Analog (if so then mode, colour/greyscale, speed)
- Bug fix: in custom forms, if a field name appeared in the data of another field it would display
     part of that field's data. 
- Changed Txed format of textarea fields. Brought up-to-date with Flmsg-2.0.12 handling of custom 
     forms special characters. Also removed quotes around TEXTAREA. Now escapes all text/numeric fields).


V1.2.0
- Added "Share" format option for printing to WIFI, Bluetooth, USB or web-enabled printers via third-party-app (PrinterShare).
- Added latitude/longitude fields prefill using GPS coordinates stored in image
- Add size limit with auto-resize when attaching pictures. Will choose between jpeg and png 
     format for the smallest file size. If jpeg is used (most cases) copy Exif info across to 
     resized picture.
- Added pilot tone options for 8PSK modes. 
- Removed preliminary 8PSK500F x 2 Carriers mode and all FEC versions.
- Added clickable link for Google Maps when viewing a "Picture Message".
- Added slanted image correction and save option.


Important To-Dos for next release:
- Add device GPS coordinates prefill


Next To-Dos:
- Add keep original picture if smaller at attachment time (e.g. back and white signature)
- Optimize bitmaps - update instead of re-create at each new line - resolve immutable issue (or
     convert to canvas drawing)
- Add progress indicator to Image Tx
- Add option of viewing message in external browser (of choice)
- Add framed display of CSV data in HTML 
- Add positive identification of message and field before sending image in analog form
- If display form not found, state "Not Implemented..."
- Update Tx time estimates for THOR11, OLIVIA and some PSK modes
- Add HTML-5 new field input controls
- When "Send all messages" pressed, ask for default picture Tx parameters. Currently uses last
     options or defaults.
- Check that when data processsing in TX is complete, the sound buffer is flushed.
- Fix slow-down on receive of large messages (> 30Kb). Use Stringbuilder.
- In IARU and Radiogram forms, check the "check button" behaviour when the message field is 
     blank (returns 1 on a blank field).


2nd order of To-Dos:
- Add option of saving received pictures in jpeg format as well as grey-scale to reduce file size (important 
     for forwarding a received message)
- Add Sample Rate Converter library with Rx and Tx PPM audio clock corrections
- Add notification when new message received
- add option to extract pictures from message to folder
- Add "Log all Rx and Tx Characters".
- Add Signature capture on screen
- Add Forms transfer over internet
- Add Base256 to compression options
- Import the AndPskmail adjustable TX tune option including toggle ON/OFF
- Add file size info in picture.htm form (for PC too)
- Add AFC screen tick box and restored AFC code for PSK and MFSK modes (important for MFSK16 in 
     particular in case of VFO drift during transmission. Assume RSID is always used at start of
     message to initially align Andflmsg on correct audio frequency.
- Resolve logcat "Unable to parse URL null" (webtextview) when selecting a field in a form (for example).
