Hello dear OMs,

This app is a combination of Fldigi and Flmsg for portable devices
 running Android.

The main objective of this development is to provide a low power 
 highly-portable, as in mobile or backpack, Flmsg/Fldigi solution. 

Rigs like the Yaesu's FT-817, Icom's 703 and Elecraft's KX3 would
 be the typical companions of the Android phone or tablet running 
 AndFlmsg, thereby providing a low weight, low energy requirement,
 access to most Flmsg services.

The integration of Internet sharing/forwarding makes this solution
 attractive as a relay option, possibly a mobile or portable station
  in a pertinent geographical location.

The inclusion of modes like MT-63 and long interleave MFSK modes allows
 audio coupling to be used effectively without the need for an audio 
 interface.

The addition of images and GPS data inclusion opens the usage to 
 practical field reporting too.

In a more developed configuration, for example with a 10” tablet 
 connected to a Bluetooth or USB keyboard plus mouse, and maybe also
 with an audio interface, the operation we get, including data input,
 nears the performance and practicality of a laptop configuration but
 without the power consumption and cost of the later. 

Also, the data entry forms can be re-modeled independently of the
 display forms in order to match the screen real-estate of the target
 devices.


 What does it do?

Basically most of what the fully featured version on the PC does. 

- Receive Flmsg formatted messages (any Form).

- Forward any form message as-is over the radio in Flmsg format OR over
 the internet via email, instant messaging (Facebook, Tweeter, ...) or
 cloud services (Dropbox, Google drive...), print services (E.g. Google
 Cloud Print).

- Copy and edit received messages for replying or further forwarding
 (all custom forms plus the following “hard coded forms”: Blank form,
 Radiogram, IARU message, Plaintext, CSV, all ICS and HICS forms at
 present, plus the “Picture Form”).

- Create new messages using any custom forms or the current set of 
 "hard coded” forms.

- Send created messages over the radio or internet.

- Define and save templates for facilitating the creation of new
 messages.

- Consult the activity log and the messages as-sent.

- The implemented modems are the FLMSG modems (including extra modes),
 that is all PSK/PSKR modes, including multi-carrier modes, some of the
 8PSK modes, THOR, MFSK, OLIVIA, MT-63 and Domino-Ex modes. The 
 performance is good as the modems now coded in native C++ code for
 performance and is heavily based on the Fldigi modems code.

Enjoy.

All the best,
